<p>This is published on npm as promise-task-runner</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar, a node task runner is mainly just a CLI gateway to javascript functions (the tasks), which have declared dependencies.  They are commonly found in build tools such as gulp and grunt.  My task runner is very similar to gulp's, but conceptually differs in how the dependencies are structured.  There are also a few bits of functionality my task runner supports which aren't available in gulp.</p>

<p>This is my first published npm package, and in attempt to battle the trend of poor documentation for open source projects, I've <a href="https://github.com/olsonpm/promise-task-runner/wiki">documented mine thoroughly</a>.  I'm happy with the result because of the effort it took to create a sensible, intuitive API as well as supporting documentation allowing anyone to pick it up.

<h3>Project Scaffolder</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/olsonpm/project-scaffolder">Here is the beginning of my project scaffolder</a>.  I'm not satisfied with the scaffolders currently available.  Most available on npm are too narrow and as a result don't serve any generic purpose.  Creating a scaffolder using Yeoman also seems overly complex.</p>

<p>My goal is to create a project scaffolder that's configurable with a base template folder from which files get added to and modified in, depending on user input. I want that template folder and configuration file to be easily modified and shared with a team so that every project shares a similar structure.  I will update this section once it's finished.</p>
