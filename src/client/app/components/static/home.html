<p>For those who don't know, my name is Phil Olson. Right now this is just a place where I'll post personal projects and other career-related info intended as a resume supplement.</p>

<p>Projects and other info can be found via the links on the right. All projects will have links to source-code, and a link to the web-page if applicable.</p>
<p>The source for this site <a href="https://github.com/olsonpm/personal-home">can be found here</a>
